**"Disparities in Medical Specialist Distribution in Thailand: An Analysis of National Health Workforce Database Between 2014 and 2023"**

## Overview

This study examines the distribution of medical specialists across Thailand over a ten-year period (2014â€“2023) using data from national health workforce records. It evaluates workforce policies, such as mandatory rural service and task-shifting, and their impacts on equity and healthcare access. The analysis provides critical insights for policymakers aiming to improve equitable access to specialist care.

## Key Features

- **Equity Analysis**: Calculation of Gini coefficients to measure disparities in specialist distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps and scatter plots to depict trends in equity and density.
- **Policy Impact Evaluation**: Analysis of targeted workforce interventions on specialist availability and distribution.

## Data Sources

1. **Specialist Distribution**: Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) open-access platform ([http://gishealth.moph.go.th](http://gishealth.moph.go.th)).
2. **Population Data**: National Population Registry, Bureau of Registration Administration, Ministry of Interior, Thailand.
3. **Healthcare Facilities**: Healthcare Facility Registry Dataset, Office of the Permanent Secretary, MOPH.

## Methods

- Equity measured using Gini coefficients at regional and provincial levels.
- Specialist-to-population ratios calculated across 13 health regions and 77 provinces.
- Data analyzed and visualized using Python and Tableau.

## Results Highlights

- **Increased Availability**: Total specialists grew significantly from 2014 to 2023, with general practitioners seeing a 210% increase.
- **Improved Equity**: Gini coefficients for general practitioners improved markedly, from 0.35 to 0.20 provincially.
- **Persistent Gaps**: Low-density specialties, such as pathology and rehabilitation medicine, remain inequitable despite progress.

## Repository Structure

- **`/data`**: Example datasets (anonymized) used in the analysis.
- **`/scripts`**: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **`/results`**: Outputs including charts, metrics, and statistical summaries.
- **`/docs`**: Additional documentation and references.
